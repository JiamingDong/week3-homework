	                    The Humboldt Park neighborhood is known for its dynamic social 
	                    and ethnic demographic change over the years and the Puerto Rican 
	                    community has identified strongly with the area since the 1970s, but 
	                    their actual presence has been on the wane due to gentrification of the 
	                    neighborhood. Humboldt Park is also the name of a 207-acre (0.8 kmÂ²) park 
	                    adjacent to the community area.",
